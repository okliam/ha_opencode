## What is OpenCode?

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) is an open-source AI coding agent that runs in your terminal. It understands your codebase, can edit files, run commands, and help you build software using natural language. Think of it as having an expert developer available 24/7 who can read your code, suggest improvements, fix bugs, and implement features.

OpenCode works by connecting to large language models (LLMs) from various providers and giving them the ability to interact with your local filesystem, execute commands, and understand context from your project.
